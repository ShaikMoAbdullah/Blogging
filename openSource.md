## What is Open Source

Open source is **source code** that is made **freely available** for possible _modification_ and _redistribution_. Products include **permission to use the source code, design documents, or the content of the product**. The **open-source model** is a **decentralized software development model** that encourages **open collaboration**. The **main purpose** of open-source is **peer production**.

## Why was open source introduced?

The **open-source movement** in software began as a response to the _limitations of proprietary code_. The idea of open source originated in **1983** from an ideological movement informally founded by **Richard Stallman**. Stallman believed that **software should be accessible to programmers so they could modify it as they wished**, understand it, learn about it, and improve it. Stallman began releasing free code under his license, called the **GNU Public License**. This new approach and ideology surrounding software creation took hold and eventually led to the formation of the **Open Source Initiative** in **1998**.

## History of Open Source(a.k.a How did Open source begin? )

Open source promotes **universal access** via an **open-source or free license** to a _product's design_ or _blueprint_, and **universal redistribution** of that _design_ or _blueprint_. Open source gained hold with the **rise of the Internet**. The open-source software movement arose to clarify **copyright**, **licensing**, **domain**, and **consumer issues**.

## How does Open source work?

Open source code is usually stored in a **public repository** and shared **publicly**. Anyone can **access the repository** to use the code independently or **contribute improvements** to the design and functionality of the overall project.

## How to contribute to Open Source Software?

- Fork the main repository to which you want to contribute to
- Clone the forked repo
- Checkout to a new branch to make your changes from the main branch
- Push the repository to the remote origin
- Make a PR linking the upstream main repository to the remote origin branch
- Go through the conversation of the PR merge process. Here, You will get feedback about your commits and you can make new commits to improve your work in the same PR
- After the PR is merged, Checkout to the main branch locally
- Copy the upstream repository link locally and run `git remote add upstream copied_upstream_link`
- Next, Run `git fetch upstream`
- Then, run `git merge upstream/main`
- Now, Your local repository is in sync with the remote repository
- Delete the branch where you made the changes locally

## Examples of Open Source Software

- Mozilla Firefox
- Linux OS
- VLC media player
- LibreOffice
- GIMP
- and many more

## Advantages of Open source software

- Open source software is **free**.
- Open source is **flexible** - Developers can examine how the code works and freely make changes to the application to better fit their unique needs.
- Open source is **stable** - The source code is **publicly distributed**, so users can depend on it for their long-term projects
- Open source comes with a **built-in community** that continuously contributes and adds value to the source code by improving it. Some examples where you can work on open source projects is [EddieHub Inclusive Open Source Community](https://www.eddiehub.org/)
