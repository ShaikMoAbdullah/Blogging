# The University Experience

When I joined **Reva University** for the first time, I saw this magnificent building and was not able to hold my eyes. I felt I had come to any historical place which was focused on architecture. If you are wondering how it is, Let me show it to you.

Isn't it amazing? I felt the same. Later we got to know that our college is built by a Real estate giant **Divyashree** Construction which is one of the prestigious construction companies in Bangalore, India the **Chairman** of DivyaShree** is **[Shyama Raju](https://twitter.com/drpshyamaraju)** who is one of the most humble humans on Earth and also the **Chancellor of Reva University**. That is why you see the architecture of the University is so well maintained.

## Inauguration ceremony

We had an Inauguration ceremony on the first day of our college. We were ready with our stylish clothes and excited to meet so many students and make new friends. We were given the introduction to the University and intros to the heads of departments of various fields in the University. That started exciting and ended up boring. After bearing for a few hours, There comes the lunch break where everyone is given free snacks and drinks. We had some and then started roaming across the University. It was a vast 45 acres of land.

Now, As we continue We were shown our respective classes on our notice boards and finally we entered our first class after our 12th grade. We had approximately 3 to 4 classes where each teacher comes up and asks us the name again and again repeatedly after each class. Believe me, It was boring. But, Now comes a teacher who takes our intro and asks us what I am embarrassed by in my first year of college. That is my 12th grade. Each student gets up and moves to the center of the dice and talks about themselves and says their 12th mark. I was somewhere in between the count and was feeling numb from inside. But, My turn had to come and I took all my breath and moved up to the dice and introduced myself, and when it came to talk about my 12th mark. I said politely to my teacher that I am not comfortable sharing my 12th marks. She asked why. I said, I did not study during my 12th and I wasted most of my time during that period. She smiled at my honesty and said you will do well here and said "All the best" and I was pumped up and went down to my chair and sat comfortably. At that moment I felt, If I were honest now, I would have been guilty from inside. Thankfully, everything went well for the day.

Now, Comes the amazing part of going back home on a bus. Here come your seniors start ragging you. One person asks me to stand and make an omelet. I stood and asked how. He said, "Imaging that you have an egg in your hand and make an act of making an omelet". I raised my hand and acted to break the egg and put it on the pan. I felt so weird, But, let's continue. One person from behind says, "Why is there no sound from the pan?" Then I made a sound like "sssss"(Omelet making sound). I said I have completed making the omelet. then another senior says to me, "Would you not serve us?". Then, I served them the omelet. Believe me, It was a horrible act. In the end of all, Everyone was satisfied and I got a seat on the bus they became one of my closest friends and helped me whenever I need their college support.

## A good part of going to University/College

You make a lot of friends
